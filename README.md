# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Description

This is a console application that solves quadratic equations. It includes two modes:

- interactive;
- not interactive;

In interactive mode, the user enters the data himself, the application accepts them and solves the quadratic equation. 
In non-interactive mode, data is read from the file specified by the user.

## Instructions for Using the Code

1. Clone the repository using the command 
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.
3. Install the dependencies using the command
```
npm install readline-sync
```
4. Run the code in interactive mode using the command 
```
node index.js
```
5. Run the code in non-interactive mode using the command 
```
node index.js <input-file>
```
The input file should contain three numbers separated by a space. Each number represents the coefficients of a quadratic equation.
